        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to EDITSMYPDF ("we", "our", "us"). We are committed to
          protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
          information on our website, particularly regarding our PDF tools and
          the use of advertising services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our core principle is privacy by design. Our PDF editing tools are
          designed to work entirely within your browser.
          <strong
            >Your files are never uploaded, stored, or transmitted to our
            servers.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>
          We do not collect any personal data or content from the files you use
          with our tools. All processing of your PDF files is done on your own
          computer (client-side). The content of your files remains private to
          you.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          While we do not collect personal data from your files, we do use
          third-party services that may collect data to operate our site and
          show ads.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Log Data:</strong> Like most websites, our servers may
            automatically log standard data provided by your web browser, such
            as your IP address, browser type, the pages you visit, and the time
            and date of your visit. This data is used for statistical purposes
            and to maintain site security.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong> We use cookies to help
            personalize your experience and for advertising purposes. A cookie
