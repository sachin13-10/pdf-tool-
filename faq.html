        <h3>Privacy & Security</h3>

        <h4>Is my data safe and private?</h4>
        <p>
          Absolutely. Your PDF files are processed entirely in your browser on your device. They are never uploaded to our servers, stored in any cloud service, or shared with third parties. We never access, track, or log any of your files. Your privacy is our highest priority.

          EDITSMYPDF does not collect personal information. We don't ask for or store your name, email, location, or any identifying information. We may collect anonymous usage statistics through Google Analytics to improve our service, but this is completely anonymous.
        </p>

        <h4>Where is my data processed?</h4>
        <p>
          All PDF processing happens on your device in your browser. No data is sent to external servers. This ensures maximum privacy and security while also providing instant processing speeds.
        </p>

        <h4>How do you make money if the service is free?</h4>
        <p>
          EDITSMYPDF is supported by non-intrusive advertising through Google AdSense. We display relevant ads on our website to fund development and server costs. We don't sell user data or track personal information.
        </p>

        <h4>How large can my PDF files be?</h4>

          The maximum file size depends on your device's available memory and browser capabilities. Most modern devices can handle PDFs ranging from 100MB to 500MB. Processing speed depends on your device's performance.

          No installation required. EDITSMYPDF is a web-based application that runs in your browser. You don't need to download, install, or configure any software.
        </p>

        <h4>What browsers are supported?</h4>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h4>Does EDITSMYPDF work offline?</h4>
        <p>
          Once loaded, EDITSMYPDF can work offline. You can load the webpage while connected to the internet, then use the tools without an active connection. However, you'll need internet to initially load the page.
        </p>

        <h4>Why does my PDF processing take so long?</h4>
        <p>
          PDF processing speed depends on your device's processor power and available memory. Larger files take longer to process. Your internet connection doesn't affect processing speed since everything happens on your device.
        </p>

        <h4>What if I encounter an error?</h4>
        <p>
          If you experience an error, please try the following: clear your browser cache, refresh the page, close other browser tabs to free up memory, or try a different browser. If the problem persists, contact us at editsmypdf@gmail.com with details about the error.
